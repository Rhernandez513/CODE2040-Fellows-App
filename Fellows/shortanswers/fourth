Describe an experience when you've had to overcome an obstacle. We want to hear
about why the moment mattered to you, the challenge you faced, and how you
overcame that challenge. Put us in the passengers seat of the moment.

  Jumping out of a truck and heading down a dirt road seems easy enough, right? 
Until you realize you’re getting out of a “humvee” and racing against time to 
get a C-130 cargo plane landed in the middle of the Arizona desert.  Every five
hundred feet, dropping down and placing a neon-orange marker panel, I could only
hoping it was angled high enough for the pilot to see.

  The arid air whipped about my face as the C-130 spun up it's engines, ready
to clear the runway after unloading it's cargo: armaments and fuel for the two
AH-1Z Super Cobra's circling overhead.  Within moments of it's departure, the
pair had touched down and a team of Marines moved to greet them.

  Although I believed at the time that my role in the precision displays of
coordination and communication had come to an end, the real work for the evening
had not yet begun.  The birds would keep coming in, the exercise in preparation
for when each passing second could determine the fate of a platoon of Marines
would continue though the night.  Such is the manner of training in the Corps,
excellence is to be expected.
