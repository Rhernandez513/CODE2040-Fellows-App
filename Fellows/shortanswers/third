Tell us about your passions outside of computing and technology.

  My passion for computing and technology is merely an extension of my
overarching passion for absorbing the vast beauty and unending possibility that
life presents before us.  From the atoms that make up the fabric of matter, to
the unimaginably large cosmos - the complex systems that make up the universe
are insignificant compared to the unique opportunity presented to those beings
lucky enough to call themselves human.  The great theoretical physicist Albert
Einstein put it succinctly as such:

  "The human mind, no matter how highly trained, cannot grasp the universe. We
   are in the position of a little child, entering a huge library whose walls
   are covered to the ceiling with books in many different tongues..."

It is the vast expanse of Einstein's take on the Borges' Library of Babel that
shines some light on my passion for learning.  Put simply, I revel in learning
everything about everything.

  The beauty of the world is not a simple one, but it has come to humanity's
understanding - in our own limited way - systemically through the efforts of
countless individuals working in concert towards the shared goal of advancing
our understanding of our place in the universe.  To live in the utopian times
that we do, is an honor and a privilege few before us could have even conceived
of.  If sentience is the only thing that sets us apart from the other creatures
of the earth, I desire nothing more than to utilize that gift to its fullest.
