Why is diversity important to the tech industry?


  Diversity is not important to the tech industry.

  Diversity is of immense importance to all facets of society.  Without
diversity - not only in the technology industry - throughout the whole of
society which we find ourselves living in, the systemic oppression of people of
color will only continue to undermine the very fabric of the American ideal:
life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

  The technology industry of today is a model for the wider economy of the
future; knowledge work that drives innovation - value provided by an individual's
abilities vice the employer's property - increasingly drive ever smaller
organizations.  Those of which are able to create products and services with
awe-inspiring efficiency.  This is the model for the future of work, and it is
this emphasis on the individual that is the critical component that will govern
the future of industry.

  No one individual can lay claim on the collective knowledge shared by the
varied backgrounds of all.  The perspective provided by the individual
experiences of peoples hailing from all walks of life is so vast, any one person whom
believes it not a critical component to the collaborative process is
either ignorant or delusional.  Humanity itself is not of a single color, sex,
or creed; the complexity of the human experience has documented for millennia,
yet escapes definition.

  No, diversity is not important to the tech industry, it's significance is
beyond definition; without both active and meaningful efforts by all parties
involved, organizations will continue to fail to draw meaningful connections
with groups of which they may have no meaningful insight, but only the homogenized
perspective of an observer.
