How would you contribute to CODE2040's mission during and after your fellowship?


  CODE2040's mission(to advance access and participation of Black and Latino/a
student's in the innovation economy) is already closely aligned with some of the
work I have been involved in, and continue to strive towards.

  For the past two years I have been involved with Brothers For Excellence - a
program of Loyola University Chicago's Department of Student Diversity and Multicultural Affairs -
which is dedicated to providing mentorship for Loyola students whom identify as
Men of Color.  Last year I was invited to return to the program as a student
mentor, a position I was honored to accept; and this year I have been involved
as a formal mentor to four first-year students.  Working with them in a myriad of
areas, from class planning and registration; to one-on-one tutoring; to issues
concerning financial aid, to how to properly engage with faculty and staff in a
professional manner.

  As a CODE2040 Fellow, I will continue to work towards empowering my peers to
engage with the innovation economy through the power of technology, by
leveraging not only my experiences as a mentor with Brothers For Excellence, but
also the skills gleaned from my time as a Corporal of Marines in years prior, as
well as a current tutor of Computer Science.

  I firmly believe that technology is the greatest tool we have available in the
pursuit of this goal.  The ability to take what is effectively only an idea, and
to place it into motion through nothing else other than sheer force of will - is
an amazing and awe-inspiring tool that should be shared with all who are willing
to learn - and should be shared with all, irrespective of the circumstances
which they are born.
